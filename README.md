# Deploy-Meraki-Network-Ansible
This is an example set of Playbooks to deploy a simple yet fairly full Meraki Network based on user input prompts, the network will contain MX, MR and MS, the playbooks will create SSIDs, VLANs, Switchport configs, and Firewall rules. 

The playbooks can be condensed or expanded upon to deploy larger networks.

To run simply input "ansible-playbook deploy_full_network.yml" and then follow the prompts, defaults are configured for VLANs.

The playbooks in this example have been sourced, changed, and updated from other git hub repositories.
